The purpose of this repo is to get you familiar with TypeScript while also helping you practice TDD (Test Driven Development)

For each exercise, there is a directory in `src/` with a name, prepended with the number you should do the exercises in (in ascending order).  You can find the prompt for each exercise in the index.ts file of each directory.
  - `index.ts` - will contain the code to write
  - `index.test.tsx` - will contain the tests for the code in `index.ts`

You can run the tests with `yarn test`.  (Don't forget to install you packages first with `yarn install`)
